# Final-Project-CS50
#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/PM-4ZvjXZeg
#### Description:
My project is a social media for slackliners, a place where you can upload your own tricks on the slack and see others one. I personally don't build my project thinking it has a value in real life, i just use it as a way to learn things that i found of interest in cs50 and that i now want to work with.
The first thing  to do when you enter the site is create a new account, and log in.
One you have done that you end up in the index where you can see all the videos that you and other users uploaded. 
On a navbar powered by bootstrap you can go to your profile where you can see all your videos on a list and erase them if you want, and you can changue your profile picture too. In the same navbar you can search a trick for his name, upload your own trick or log out.
I made the back end  with python, flask and sqlite the code is in app.py and helpers.py.
The front end with JavaScript and Vue.js.
All this on vscode. So the folder contains a **.vscode** folder with two json file for the launch settings, a **db** folder with the database in it, an **env** folder for the virtual enviroment where you run the program, the **static** folder for flask that inside have three more folders, one is * *profilePics* * that stores all the users profile's photos, the other one is * *skins* * that have all the svg used in the design, and the folder * *videos* * where the videos are stored. The last folder is **templates** where all the html files are.
This html files have the css and the JS inside them.
